This site provides prerelease, draft documentation for the Toast hosted checkout API.
The information in this documentation is intended for early review by

start development work until you receive explicit confirmation from your Toast
integration contact. If you have questions, please contact the Toast
integrations team.

endpoints, parameters, responses, and data types of the hosted checkout API.
